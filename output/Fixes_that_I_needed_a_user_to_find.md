# Fixes that I needed a user to find


It's easier for someone to use something if they have become familiar with it. When I work on projects, I know what I want it to look like, and how it works. Recently, I have finished a list of changes that I would make to my portfolio and personal projects.

I finished everything on my current list and thought everything looked good, so I started showing all of my close family members and coworkers what they thought. One person in particular was having a hard time using my portfolio site, and I had to explain how to simply navigate it. I did not blame her, but I knew that I could fix just a few things to make navigating easier.

I noticed first, that my user did not even think to scroll down the page after the first paragraph. I thought of ways I could clue the user into scrolling down. I came up on the idea of a downwards pointing arrow that bobs and disappears after scrolling.

Next, I noticed that my user was trying to click on a heading label. I removed the underline from the text and made the font the same as all other headings.

Finally, my user had no indication of the current page she was on, so she clicked on her current tab a few times before realizing what she was doing. I knew that I needed to update my navbar styles and give an indication of the current page.

My portfolio is much easier to navigate now with these simple changes. You can find my site at [https://tylertrout.com](http://tylertrout.com)
