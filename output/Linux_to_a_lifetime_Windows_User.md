# Linux to a lifetime Windows User


Microsoft Windows was the first operating system that I had ever used. I was introduced to computers with a hand me down Windows XP desktop from my parents. I had never had the chance to try an Apple computer until middle school. I remember that I was bewildered by the fact that the mouse had no right click. Mac became usable to me once I understood the basics, but I had always preferred Windows.

I do not remember the first time that I heard about Linux, but the concept seemed very different from what I had expected about computers at the time. I did not understand how a free software that is not maintained by one company, but rather distributed and developed by hundreds, all with the something called "open source", could all call themselves "*Linux*".

Not until recently had I decided to give it a try. I first started with (like most people) Ubuntu. I installed Ubuntu, but soon switched to Mint, after doing more some more research. I really enjoyed Linux Mint as it was designed to feel very familiar to a Windows user.

I was enjoyed Linux Mint for the time I used it. I am somewhat familiar with the command line interface from Windows, so the terminal felt right at home for me. Although it is true that Linux expects you to use the terminal, that really is not as scary as it sounds. It basically comes down to googling (or DuckDuckGo if you're like me) anything you need to do, and copying and pasting.

Although I had enjoyed Mint, I ran into problems with my Nvidia drivers, and the whole thing became too much of a headache to worry about, so I decided to try out another distribution, Pop!\_os, (or just Pop! for short).

Pop! is my currently installed distribution, and I like it because it works almost right out of the box for games thanks to the elimination of that pesky driver problem mentioned earlier. Pop! is not so much geared towards mimicking Windows like Mint is, but it is very easy to understand. Almost anyone could easily get started with Pop! in minutes.

Linux is as hard as you want it to be these days. I really think Linux is something that anyone can do, and it is well worth the effort to understand it. I personally am just getting started to learning Linux, and understand that there is a deep underbelly to Linux to explore, and some parts are pretty scary, I did try Arch on a virtual machine once.
