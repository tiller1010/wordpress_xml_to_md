# Gears amp Grub site and more progress


At the time of this writing, one of my first client websites, [Gears & Grub](http://gearsandgruberie.com), is near completion. Gears & Grub is a gathering of food trucks, vendors, and motorcycles. The event has good food and music, and it is in downtown Erie this year. The event is quickly approaching, so getting the site ready has been a major priority of mine. Working on the site made me realize how small of a world we live in. I have spotted many of the trucks, vendors, and participants listed on the site, and some of which I even know or have spoken with.

Also at this time, I am to give a talk at the next Coderie meetup. My talk is going be on my own experiences and how to approach the self-taught route. The talk should help out anyone debating on taking their education into their own hands as well as people who may just want some tips on finding answers for themselves. This will be my first time speaking in front of other developers, and it should give me the confidence to give future talks.
