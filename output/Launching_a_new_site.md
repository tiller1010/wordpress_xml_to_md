# Launching a new site


I recently met with the owner of Dobbins Dogs to finalize his site and launch it. Before we got started, he gifted me with a Dobbins Dogs shirt. I took the opportunity to give him one of my new work business cards. We discussed any final revisions he would want before setting his site up under its domain. You can visit the site at [dobbinsdogs.com](http://dobbinsdogs.com). The site features a single page with testimonials and various contact methods.
