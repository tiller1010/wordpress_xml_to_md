# Tyler Trouts Blog


Today, I am starting my first WordPress blog to improve my writing ability and to have a place to document new things that I learn. I bought a domain name and hosting with Hostinger. I have never hosted any of my projects on anything other than GitHub pages. I have heard horror stories of other hosting services injecting harmful code into websites so the whole process seemed daunting at first. However, Hostinger seemed to be the best choice for me. Their service is extremely affordable, and they have great customer service. When setting all of this up, I struggled to understand how to migrate my local version of WordPress to the internet. To my surprise, all it took were a few Google searches and a friendly conversation with one of their support members for me to be on my way. Hostinger seems to have hundreds of helpful articles that make this process easier than I imagined. After I was online, I took to the WordPress store to find a decent looking theme that I could create a child variation of. I found 'Bloggo' to be a clean and neat base theme. I spent a few hours changing the color scheme and font to make the theme my own, and here we are, all up and running. All I needed now was to write a post, and this will be the first of many posts posts that will appear on my blog.
