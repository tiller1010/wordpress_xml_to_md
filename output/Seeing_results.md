# Seeing results


When I first started coding on a daily basis, I had researched that the best way to get started was to put in consistent practice. Most things that I had previously imagined as "too difficult" or "confusing" were simply overcome by a little research and perhaps some trial and error. I have learned so much since the time I first began, and I also know that there is so much more to know. As of now, I am a week into my first internship at a small tech company. I have accepted free and paid work from a few small businesses, food trucks, and events. I feel privileged to have more time to work on what I like to do, and learn from real experience.
