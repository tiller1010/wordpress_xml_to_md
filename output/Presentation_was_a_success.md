# Presentation was a success


I recently gave a presentation at the Coderie meetup group. My talk was about the strategies I use to teach myself, instead of going through a traditional education system. Many of those who attended the meetup have been in the field for some time or even own businesses of their own. I had some initial jitters about the idea, but I am glad that I was able to leave my comfort zone. I got to talk one on one with some very experienced people who congratulated me on my talk.
